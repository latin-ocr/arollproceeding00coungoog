os aa aaa orranuay 1661, the nastes or ne aon
submitted to the 'Ireasury a proposal for the publication

of materiale for the Histcry of this Oountry from the
Invasion of the Romans to the reign of Henry VIII.

The Master ot the Rolls suggested that these materiola
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodicnl or chronological
arrangement, without mutilaticn or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most scarae and valuable. Ι

Η6 proposed that esch chronicle or historical docu-
ment to be edited should he treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; aud
tor this purpose the most comest text should be formed
Irom an accurate collation ot the hest MSS.

'Io render the work more generally useful, tha Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, ot their age and
their· peculiarities3 that he should add to tho work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary tc explain the chronology3 but
no other note cr comment was to be allowed, except
what might be necessary to establish the correctness ot

thetext. ⁸2
