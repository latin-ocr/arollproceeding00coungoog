The works to he published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the tash
testing upon the editors, who were to be chosen bytho
Master of the Rolls with the sanction ol the lheasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, aiter a careful
consideration ol the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “ was well
calculated lor the accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangements‚
without unnecessary expense.”

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each Chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct-
ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation ol
the best MSS, and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the prefaoe to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulare proposed hythe
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
so far aa authentic materials existed lor that purpose,

and an estimato of his historioal credibility and velue.
