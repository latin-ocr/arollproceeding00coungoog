with a short intermission until the early part of 1442,
Whilst Deputy he held aParliament at Dublin on the
16th of November, 1441 ; and it appears from the sixth
document printed in the Appendix thet he must have
been appointed Lord Lieutenant in the room of Lord
Welles before the 5th of June 1442, for he is at that date
termed “ Locumtenens Domini Regis.'' His tenure of
these offices is thus stated in the record of the Great
Oouneil held at Drogheda on June 26th, 1444, vin, “ for
one year Deputy to Lord Welles, and for two years and
more Lieutenont of the King himself '¹ (see p. 308 infra).
This places Ormonde's appointment aa Lord Lieutenant
sometime before June 1442, which is a year before the
date given by Ware, and generally accepted. Itis pro·
bable, however, that a still earlier date should be fixod,
fora letter from the King to the Chancellor of Ireland,¹
dated on the 2411] of the previous March, which men·
tione Ormonde os having been Deputy when the Parlie·

ment vves held in Dublin in November 1441, clearly
implies that the Earl had been appointed Lord Lieu-
tenanta considerable time before the reception of the
mesaage sent by that Parliament. Archbishop Talbot,
and While, Abbot of St. Mary’s Dublin‚ had gone to

England· carly in 1442111111 the messege elluded to
and ansvered in this letter; but the Archbishop and
his fellow “messengers'' were also the hearers ofa
representation agreed on by a strong party in thet
Parliament, led by Archbishop Talbot, and hostile to
Ormonde, and the Arehbishop himself seems to have
been the author of this fifth article of the Appendix,
there printed from a contemporary MS. in the Cotton 001-
lection, which is now imperfect at the commendement.

volume of the “Proceedings &e of the Privy Oounoil in
